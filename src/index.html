            Marcus Aurelius was the son of the praetor Marcus Annius Verus and
            his wife, Domitia Calvilla. He was related through marriage to the
            emperors Trajan and Hadrian. Marcus's father died when he was three,
            and he was raised by his mother and paternal grandfather. After
            Hadrian's adoptive son, Aelius Caesar, died in 138, Hadrian adopted
            Marcus's uncle Antoninus Pius as his new heir. In turn, Antoninus
            adopted Marcus and Lucius, the son of Aelius. Hadrian died that
            year, and Antoninus became emperor. Now heir to the throne, Marcus
            studied Greek and Latin under tutors such as Herodes Atticus and
            Marcus Cornelius Fronto. He married Antoninus's daughter Faustina in
            145.
